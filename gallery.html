                        <h2>PEOPLE IN CHAPEL (2025)</h2>
						<img src="images/gallery/traditional/PeopleInChapel.jpg">
						<p>
							<strong><em>People In Chapel</em></strong>  was designed by a talented young artists who wanted to recreate Leonardo Da Vinci's style in the modern age.
							<br><br>
							As the creator explains, their process took one single try, asking their AI to: <br>
							"Generate an Image In Leonardo Da Vinci's art style" <br> <br>
							What resulted is this beautiful piece, where you can see hands melding into clothes, uncanny faces that look as if they are melting, and what we assume is a chapel.
						</p>

						<h2>TRANQUILITY (2031)</h2>
						<img src="images/gallery/traditional/Tranquility.jpg">
						<p>
							<strong><em>TRANQUILITY</em></strong> is a wonderful landscape background depicting a a peaceful green meadow.<br><br>
							Note the disintigration of the piece into unexplainable grey piping in the top left corner, or how the water does not follow any logic whatsoever, or how you cannot tell what animal is in the background.<br><br>
							This piece exemplifies a peaceful soul and is a beautiful piece, assuming you squint your eyes and stand very far away.

						<h2>THE MAN (2034)</h2>
						<img src="images/gallery/traditional/TheMan.jpg">
						<p>
							<strong><em>THE MAN</em></strong> attempts to encapsulate the same enthrall as the widely known Mona Lisa. <br> <br>
							<strong><em>THE MAN</em></strong> underwent several iterations, as the creator prompted their AI to generate self portraits. What stood out with this iteration was that it actually looked like a person, rather than an amorphous blob with human like qualities.

						<h2>THE ROOM OF VAN GOGH &#40;2032&#41;</h2>
						<img src="images/gallery/traditional/RoomOfGogh.jpg">
						<p>
							<strong><em>The Room of van Gogh</em></strong> uses the power of CoPilot to combine the elements found in Vincent can Gogh's most popular painints, such as "Starry Night," "Sunflowers," and "The Bedroom."<br><br>
							It is a stunning combination, celebrating years of van Gogh's efforts perfecting his pieces by creating a remix in 2 minutes.
							<br><br>
							The AI artist who submitted this piece commented:<br>
							"Is that what they are? I just told it to make a van Gogh painting."

						<h2>THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE</h2>
						<img src="images/gallery/photography/GoldenGateBridge.jpg">
						<p>
							<strong><em>The Golden Gate Bridge</em></strong> is a photogrpah (generated by AI) depicting the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.<br><br>
							The truly amazing part is that the AI Photographer has never even been to California or even seen the Golden Gate Bridge in their entire lives, and yet they generated this inaccurate photo. <br> <br>
							Note how the composition makes it look as if the bridge's wires are broken and collapsing, and how the framing makes the bridge way smaller than it is in real life. <br> <br>
							It is the perfect depiction of what the Golden Gate Bridge looks like if you described it to someone from memory.
						</p>

					<div class="img-box">
						<h2>NIGHTTIME</h2>
						<img src="images/gallery/photography/CosmicPillar.png">
						<p>
							<strong><em>Nighttime</em></strong> depicts exactly as the title states: A nighttime sky filled with shining stars. <br> <br>
							We asked the creator what their inspiration for this piece was and they states: <br> <br>
							"Well I was taking a walk at night, looked up to find a beautiful night sky, and I knew what I had to do. I pulled out my phone, opened the ChatGPT app and told it to generate an image of a night sky. I stared at my phone for what had to be 5 whole minutes before settling on this iteration. I then won 8 awards." <br> <br>
							Truly, a masterpiece.

						<h2>BUSTLING CITY</h2>
						<img src="images/gallery/photography/BustlingCity.png">
						<p>
							<strong><em>Bustling City</em></strong> uses the uncanny valley of generative AI to create a photograph of a lively city. <br> <br>
							This photo features signs with indecipherable text, people with melting faces, and cars in locations they should not be in. <br> <br>
							This photo depicts a city that follows no logic and is more of a mismash of random city related things shoved into one single image.

						</p>

					<div class="img-box">
						<h2>F L A M I N G O N E</h2>
						<img src="images/gallery/photography/FLAMINGONE.jpg">
						<p>
							<strong><em>F L A M I N G O N E</em></strong> was submitted by Miles Astray, who uses one of the very much intended quirk of generative AI art of not looking correct to create this humourous image of a flamingo missing it's head. <br><br>
							<strong><em>F L A M I N G O N E</em></strong> is one of our best pieces, as despite that it was generated by AI, it looks completely real. <br> <br>
							We inquired Miles about the AI Generative Model he used, and he jokingly responded: <br>
							"I didn't."<br><br>
							Mile's piece is truly a marvel to witness, and we still do not understand how he accomplished such a task.
